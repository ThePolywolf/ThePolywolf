# Dallin Wolfer

Hello day to all.

My name is Dallin Wolfer, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in Computer Science and Data Science.


## About Me

I am currently learning big-data programming, docker, and cloud computing. 

My current goals are to further learn more about creating AI systems, and create at least 2 useful open-source python packages.

I am a big advocate for NOT using AI to write code; It is much more valuable to use AI like API documentation, and to do all the problem solving on your own. This will always result in a better product, as well as you better understanding what is happening within the code.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python
  - Polars, PySpark, Pandas, SciKit-Learn
- C#/.NET
